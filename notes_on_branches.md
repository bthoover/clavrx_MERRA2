1.) test_old (old but working merra code with exception of water equivalent snow depth)
2.) new_merra2_structure (new code version which modularizes functionality and attempts to remove global variables causing headaches in old version ... particularily with movement of where the global variables get defined or dependency on the code getting called from the command line.)
